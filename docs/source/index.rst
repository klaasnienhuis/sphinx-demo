Welcome to Klaas Nienhuis Demo's documentation!
===============================================

This site describes how to set up documentation just like this. It accompanies a blog article on `klaasnienhuis.nl <https://www.klaasnienhuis.nl>`_. This documentation is generated by a python module called sphinx. It's targeted at writing documentation for python tools, but it's very suitable for prose documentation. The design is based on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_

I'll cover installing Python and Sphinx on a clean system, setting up a documentation template, a few basic syntax rules and finally hosting it on github pages.
