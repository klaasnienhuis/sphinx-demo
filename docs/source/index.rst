Welcome to Klaas Nienhuis Sphinx tutorial!
==========================================

This site describes how to set up documentation just like this. It accompanies a blog article on `klaasnienhuis.nl <https://www.klaasnienhuis.nl>`_. This documentation is generated by a python module called sphinx. I use it for most of my scripts for 3dsMax. The design is based on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_

I'll cover installing Python and Sphinx on a clean system, setting up a documentation template, a few basic syntax rules and finally hosting it on github pages.

You can get the sourcecode of the documentation on `github <https://github.com/klaasnienhuis/TOC>`_.
