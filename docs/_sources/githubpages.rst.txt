Github Pages
============

Writing docs is fine and dandy, but people need to read it. You can host your docs yourself, since it's just html. But why host it yourself when github will host it for you, for free? 

To get this working you'll need a github account. Check out how that works `here <https://pages.github.com/>`_. You'll need to take care of your folder structure. You can either put the index file of your docs in a ``docs`` folder, or use a separate branch for the documentation.

Also keep in mind that after uploading your documentation to github, it might take up to 10 minutes to generate the site. Be patient! Also essential is that there's a ``nojekyll`` file in your build. This should have been created when you used the quickstart (:ref:`firstproject`) and chose that setting. 

Create a Github repository
--------------------------

There are several ways to get started with Github, but you'll have to create an account and create a repository. I've made a public repo like so

*Create a new github repository*

Clone the repo
--------------

With any github client, or with the git commandline, you can clone the repository to your local machine (where you're writing the documentation). Github will ask you where to clone the repo to.

Once the repo has been cloned, move your documentation files to the folder.
